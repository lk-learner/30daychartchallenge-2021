Tools
Do not care what tool you use. Whatever works for you is fine! Programing, designing, crafting — pick what you prefer or try different things. An extensive list of tools can be found at Visualising Data.

Data
You are free to pick whatever data you want—we do not provide any particular dataset for each challenge. Either use the same dataset for all or different datasets each day, as you like! Search the internet, collect your own, visualize daily experiences or funny stats. Nevertheless, we would like to provide a starter kit of possible data sources:

Google dataset search

kaggle

Data Is Plural

Eurostats

UN Stats

WHO

OECD Stats

Chart Type Selection

There are many great selection helpers out there, guiding you through the many different boxes you can fit the endless number of (sub)chart types in. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

Graphic Continuum by Jon Schwabish and Severino Ribecca — the main source for the five categories

Visual Vocabulary by the Financial Times Visual Journalism — chart choice helpers with lots of further links

interactive version

static version

From Data to Viz by Yan Holtz — interactive, with information and codes for each chart type

R code collection

Python code collection

D3js code collection

DataVizProject by ferdio — interactive with lots of examples

Visualization Universe by Adioma and Google News Lab
